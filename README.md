# Public Projects from Patrick Durante
Here are some of the projects I have written that might help somebody out.

# macblock.py
Will block a mac address that is NOT on the allowed list for the Ubiquity Unifi controller.
  - Compares the list of connected vs allowed addresses.
  - Sends an email once a person is blocked using standard mail command.
  - Allows you to put a comment after each mac. This allows you to label who each mac address belongs to.

# aws_es_cleanup.sh
Simple script to remove indices older than X days run via cron for hosted AWS elasticsearch service.
