# Public Projects from Patrick Durante
Here are some of the projects I have written that might help somebody else out.

# macblock.py
Will block any address on the Ubiquity Unifi controller that is not on the allowed list.
  - Compares the list of connected vs allowed addresses.
  - Sends an email once a person is blocked.
  - Allows you to put a comment after each mac to add a description that is ignored.
